# bootstrap-grid-only
##a bootstrap css file compiled with just the grid system and responsive utils.
All the bootstrap framework is very big and I just use the grid system. So I just recompile a custom edition and made some changes. If you want, you can make your version, including or excluding features http://getbootstrap.com/customize/. 
##Installation
```
npm install bootstrap-grid-only
```
##Usage
Look at http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid.
The diference between the original bootstrap and this the padding and margins in 0 by default.
